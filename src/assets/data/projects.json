I had just finished my Master's degree and was very keen to try to get a tech startup going. The original tech, as my father had put an idea together, was running off of Wordpress. Wordpress is great for all sorts of websites and I tried to get the idea working with Wordpress but I ran into some difficulties trying to build an API around it for the mobiles apps and I wasn't a big fan of the Wordpress styling either.",

It was a simple website that just showed what Townaide did and links (eventually) to the apps. I chose ReactJS because I didn't know the framework and wanted to learn it as I had heard a lot of good things about it online. So creating a simple website was an easy way to learn the basics. The screenshot of the website below is after two years of development. I had added an interactive map to the home screen that could display the markers for a user based on their location (either by giving us their location permission or IP location).",
