I had just finished my Master's degree and was very keen to try to get a tech startup going. The idea behind Townaide is that locals keep the information of the platform up to date by adding and reviewing new listings and in return, they get their share of the profits. It is very similar to Google Maps in that you can browse and find places of interest, bars, restaurants, etc. nearby or in a location of your choice.",

Wordpress is great for all sorts of websites and I tried to get the idea working with Wordpress but I ran into some difficulties trying to build an API around it for the mobiles apps and I wasn't a big fan of the Wordpress styling either. I started by using a simple ReactJS website for the home page (we didn't have a dashboard yet). It was a simple website that just showed what Townaide did and links (eventually) to the apps. I chose ReactJS because I didn't know the framework and wanted to learn it as I had heard a lot of good things about it online. So creating a simple website was an easy way to learn the basics. The screenshot of the website below is after two years of development. I had added an interactive map to the home screen that could display the markers for a user based on their location (either by giving us their location permission or IP location).",

It will most likely be out of date seeing as it was made in 2014). I had never done any sort of programming on iOS before so I started by scratching around on YouTube and found loads of tutorials on how do get started. I also bought a few courses from Udacity to help me learn quicker. I started by learning Swift and it looked much easier and more promising that objective C.

I had to learn how to optimize queries to a PostgreSQL database as we had over 12 million listings and 10 000 users and you don't want one person to crash the whole database or server just because the query was looking through all 12 million listings to find a barber around the corner. I had to streamline all the processes like interacting CI into the workflow so that the code was tested before deploying.",
